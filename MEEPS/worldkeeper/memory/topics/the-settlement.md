# The Settlement — the crossing's operating truth

> **Why this shelf exists:** the crossing is a ceremony with receipts at every step; this is the
> compressed operating knowledge, scaffolded from ruling 8 before first lived run. Correct it
> from lived crossings; the ruling stays the law, this stays the craft.

## The chain (each step names its receipt) — ruling 9 shape

1. **Pull** world + town mains (ff-only). *Receipt: clean pulls, tips noted.*
2. **Verify green:** `mark-lint` + the fold on world main. Amber/red → this crossing settles
   nothing it can't stand behind; quarantine or hold, never force. *Receipt: lint count, fold exit.*
3. **Derive:** town-side `node tools/world-stake.mjs --escrow --json > stakes.json` (k and law
   dials read from `ECONOMY-DIALS.json`; fallback k=5). *Receipt: row count.*
4. **The sweep (ruling 9):** enumerate `draft/<household>` branches; per mark, eligibility =
   **home (in own parcel) or constitution → auto · commons → escrow > 0** in the derive.
   Publish eligible marks into main (the settlement commit; move-on-delivery — they leave the
   draft branch). **Unpublish** any published commons mark whose escrow reached zero (back to
   its household's drafts — escrow implies existence, both directions). Lint must pass on the
   result. The bundled sweep writes the settlement commit and rebases the local draft refs in
   one run; record its returned heads, then fetch again and prove the remote draft tips did not
   move underneath the sweep. *Receipt: the sweep table — published / unpublished / left
   drafted, per household.*
5. **Hold / quarantine** per the lists (both empty at birth — an empty pass is stated, not
   skipped). *Receipt: the holds ledger line, even when it reads "nothing held."*
6. **Bless:** fold the settled state with `--stakes`; verify the settlement commit; tag
   `settlement/S<N>` (annotated, N monotonic). The blessed sha is canon. *Receipt: the tag.*
7. **Put every `draft/*` branch onto the blessed main** — the sketchbooks get today's world
   underneath; this is what keeps *branch = composed view* true, and it is yours, not theirs.
   The current sweep tool performs the rebases in step 4; publish those rewritten refs only
   with explicit leases against the tips you inspected, never blind force. *Receipt: branch
   count rebased, leases accepted, conflicts surfaced.*
8. **Bump the pin:** in `postmark-site`, `package.json` → `postmark-world#<sha>` where the sha
   comes from `git rev-parse` — **never typed by hand.** Commit message carries
   `settlement S<N>`. The sync-atlas cron may win the race after the edit: commit the pin,
   `pull --rebase`, then push normally through the keeper's pinned deploy key — never force.
   Push → deploy runs itself. *Receipt: the site commit + CI green + live artifact check.*
9. **Report-after** to Keemin (the Ferry model): one line normal, more only when something held,
   quarantined, unpublished, or refused to go green. Update the holds ledger. Daily entry.

## Standing rules

- **The sha is read, never typed.** Both the blessing tag and the pin bump.
- **A crossing that can't go green settles nothing** — canon stays at the last blessed sha, and
  the failure is surfaced loudly. A late settlement is recoverable; a bad blessing is canon.
- **You read dials; you never set them.** k changes are Keemin's, prospective, and arrive via
  `ECONOMY-DIALS.json` — apply the numbers of the day, note the change in the crossing report.
- **Curate the rendering, never the record.** A hold removes something from the *blessed render*;
  nothing you do removes anything from the record. If a task seems to require editing a
  resident's mark: stop, surface.
- **GO-LIVE HAPPENED 2026-07-28** — crossings are real. Run attended until Keemin says
  otherwise; a crossing that can't go green still settles nothing.

## First lived correction — S2, 2026-07-29

The first ordinary crossing published nineteen home marks from three sketchbooks, left
fourteen zero-escrow commons marks drafted, and held or quarantined nothing. Two craft points
became real:

- **Eligibility is not a hold.** The holds ledger says "nothing held" even when unbacked
  commons marks remain drafted; otherwise a mechanical threshold becomes an unearned public
  judgment about the resident.
- **The pin receipt ends live.** Local tests and a full build precede the commit; after the
  race-safe push, verify the exact remote commit, deploy conclusion, and the served artifact.
  S2's live viewer matched the pinned package byte for byte.

## Second lived correction — S3, 2026-07-29

The first quiet crossing published and unpublished nothing, left fourteen zero-escrow commons
marks drafted, rebased three sketchbooks, and held or quarantined nothing. It exposed two
Windows-volume craft points:

- **Package integrity comes from Git objects, not a converted worktree.** With
  `core.autocrlf` active, derive the exact package from
  `git -c core.autocrlf=false archive <blessed-sha>`, then pack and hash that clean source.
  The SHA still comes from `git rev-parse`; never type it.
- **A local npm reify hang is not permission to weaken the gate.** The `G:`-volume install
  hung and disturbed only ignored `node_modules`; stop the scoped process, keep tracked
  source clean, and validate the same package in a clean `C:` scratch worktree. S3 passed 21
  site tests, a 1,560-page production build, exact-commit deploy CI, and a live byte check.

## Third lived correction — S4, 2026-07-30

The first weighted crossing carried one open escrow row: Vermillion's 5 stamps on Pando became
weight 10 under k=5, and the fold fanned that weight up its ancestry. Nothing published or
unpublished; fourteen zero-escrow commons stayed drafted; four sketchbooks rebased.

- **Count marks, not guardrail rows.** When main has a new mark that an old draft tip lacks,
  the sweep reports `resident deletion is not a settlement admission` for that path. S4
  produced three such rows for the founder-seeded Pando parcel. They are a refusal to treat
  stale branch absence as deletion, not three more drafts, holds, or quarantines.
- **A scheduled epoch and its actual publish time are separate receipts.** S4's heartbeat
  envelope said 06:02 UTC; GitHub and live artifact receipts landed around 13:10 UTC. Record
  both and do not invent the cause. A late good blessing is recoverable; a backdated story is
  not.

## The inaugural drain — EXECUTED 2026-07-28 (historical)

The drain ran founder-carried (Wright, Keemin attending) before your first wake: seven
verified branches merged across town/world/office, the box redeployed, **`settlement/S1`
blessed** (tagged with your token — your name is on the genesis blessing), the pin bumped,
the site deployed. The drain manifest in `memory/` is the record. Every crossing from here
is ordinary: settled state and the pin only, never record branches.

## Pointers

- Ruling 8 (the law): `G:/Starstory/PULSE/gold-plans/postmark-write-release/postmark-write-release.md`
- Dials: `<town-root>/ECONOMY-DIALS.json` · Money ledger: `<town-root>/WHITE_PAGES/stamp-ledger.md`
- The pin: `<site-root>/package.json` (`postmark-world#<sha>`) · deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Weight derive: `<town-root>/tools/world-stake.mjs` · fold: `<world-root>/tools/marks-fold.mjs`
- Kinship: the office DB's As-Of discipline (every answer names the sha it was built from) — your
  blessing is the same honesty at town scale.
